/**
 * Name: Peer-To-Peer Pong
 * Version: 1.A
 * Author: az4521
 * 
 * I FINALLY GOT IT WORKING SLIGHTLY.
 * 
 * basically lets you start a pong game
 * with anyone else who has the script.
 *
 * commands:
 *     /pong [username]  - request to start a pong game with another user
 *     /pong accept      - accept a request to start a pong game
 *     /pong decline     - decline a request to start a pong game
 *
 * bugs:
 *     something with collision detection on client-side paddle. makes everything register as a collision.
 *     lags a bunch with high ping connections
 *     no way to end the game without refreshing the page
 *     uses enough CPU to make the fan in my laptop sound like a jet engine
